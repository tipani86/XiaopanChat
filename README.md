# 小潘 Xiaopan.AI Chatbot
A chat service built using Streamlit, OpenAI and Azure APIs

## Introduction
I was curious whether I could build a ChatGPT-like service over one weekend. [Turns out I could](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-i-built-my-own-chatgpt-almost-free-less-than-24-hours-tianyi-pan/).

But I wanted to improve the app still, so I kept working on it and added many more features later. This is the ongoing repo for my project.

## Current Features

- Basic chatbot functionality built on top of OpenAI APIs
- WeChat login for basic user management and chat tokens tracking
- Azure Speech integration to let the bot also speak
- Payment integration with Alipay to add more chat tokens

## Roadmap

1. Investigate the possibility of referrals, earning tokens by inviting friends
